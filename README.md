# structure

A structure is a keyword that creates user-defined data types in C/C++. 
A structure creates a data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type. 

We can use this data type to store data of different attributes of different data types.
For example, If we want to store data on multiple patients such as patient name, age, and blood group.

‘struct’ keyword is used to create a structure.

Structure members cannot be initialized with declaration.

The C structure does not allow the struct data type to be treated like built-in data types.
